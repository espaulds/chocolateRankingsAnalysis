# Chocolate Bar Ratings Dataset
Exploring Factors that Contibute to Chocolate Bar Ratings

## Introduction
To explore the question of what factors contribute to higher ratings in chocolate bars. Initially, I wanted to know where the best chocolate came from. After finding this dataset, I was further intrigued and wanted to know which company was best to buy from and which percent cocoa in chocolate bars was the best. I even looked at patterns demonstrated by the creator of the dataset to account for potential bias. 

### Questions in my Exploration: 
1. which country of bean origin produces the best chocolate (best average ratings)? the worst?
2. what cocoa percentage produces the best chocolate (best average ratings)? the worst?
3. which company manufacturer gets the best average ratings? the lowest?
4. which year of doing these ratings has the highest average ratings? the lowest?

### Dataset Source:
I used a dataset generated by the founder of Manhattan Chocolate Society: Brady Brenlinski. Brady has reviewed 2,500+ chocolate bars since 2006. The Dataset includes each barâ€™s manufacturer, company location, review date, country of bean origin, ingredients, percent cocoa, most memorable characteristics, and its numerical rating. Brady supplied a copy-paste-able data set open for communal use. 

### Process:
I started my thought-process behind this project by first roughly pseudocoding how I thought my code should be written. I knew that I needed a method to parse through the CSV file and grab information from specific columns (Company (Manufacturer), Cocoa Percent, Review Dates, & Country of Bean Origin) as well as one just to parse through the ratings (Rating) column. I wanted to use ArrayLists so there was room to expand the dataset (or be used in other datasets as well). Once I figured out those methods, I moved on to helper methods that would help organize my process/my code, as well as break-up my code to make it more traceable, ledgeable, and easiar to debug. Some of these include aptly named methods such as getRidOfDuplicates, which gets rid of duplicate items in an ArrayList, or averageRating, which gets the average rating of each item in an ArrayList. I knew that most of my ArrayLists would have to be parallel in order to make great use of the indexOf attribute that would make finding certain elements within the ArrayLists faster and simpler. Finally, I add extra methods that made certain aspects, such as what the highest and lowest average ratings of the items were, clearer/more visable to the viewer. 

### Challenges:
I was struck by a lot of challenges while coding for this exploration. One challenge that stands out in particular was that my code read commas within quotes (so within on column) as delimiters and separated an element/token into multiple elements/tokens. This made it so the index for which column was being parsed was correct, however my code was retaining incorrect information reguarding the question asked. This problem was made obvious when I was unable to parse through the ratings (Rating) column within the CSV file
